Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Pseudocode is easier to understand. When writing an algorithm /program is better to use pseudocode first to explain the logic of what that algorithm/ program should do, and after write the code.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Pseudocode is meant to be read by humans not by computers- on a computer it won’t work.

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

Input 2 numbers 
IF first number greater than second number
PRINT first number
ELSE
PRINT second number
END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

SET 1 as the starting number
WHILE adding 1 to each number from 1
PRINT that number out
END WHILE
RETURN all the numbers until 100

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

SET UP a phonebook  ARRAY with NAMES
FOR sort through  array and 
IF entry equals NAME
RETURN  that name
ELSE print NO ENTRY match  
END IF
END FOR

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function findEntry(entry){
var phonebook = ['Mads', 'Ella'];
for (var i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++){

if (phonebook[i] === entry) {
return "We found your search: " + "  " + entry;
} else {
 return "We don't have your search”;
}
}
};

findEntry('Mads');
