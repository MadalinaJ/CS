Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Pseudocode is easier to understand. When writing an algorithm /program is better to use pseudocode first to explain the logic of what that algorithm/ program should do, and after write the code.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Pseudocode is meant to be read by humans not by computers- on a computer it wonâ€™t work.

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

Input 2 numbers 
IF first number greater than second number
PRINT first number
ELSE
PRINT second number
END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.


SET currentNumber to 1
WHILE currentNumber is less than 101
  PRINT currentNumber
  INCREMENT currentNumber by 1
END WHILE

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FUNCTION findEntry (input NAME parameter)
  SET phonebook to an ARRAY with names
  FOR each entry in the phonebook
    IF entry equals NAME parameter
      RETURN that name  
    END IF
  END FOR
  RETURN "No match found"
END FUNCTION


4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function findEntry(name){
  var phonebook = ['Mads', 'Ella'];
  for (var i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++){

   if (phonebook[i] === name) {
    return "We found a match: " +  "  " + name;
   } 
  }
    return ' no match found ';
 }

findEntry('Ella');
